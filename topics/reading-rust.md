## Reading Rust 
- ```&T``` :  an immutable reference (safe pointer) to a value of type T
- ```&mut T```  : a mutable reference (safe pointer) to value of type T
- ```* const T``` : an raw pointer ( that can't mutate the value ) to a value of type T
- ```* mut T``` : a raw pointer (that can mutate the value ) to a value of type T
- ```?Sized``` : optionally complying the trait bound ```Sized````
- ```Rc<T>``` : single threaded reference counted safe pointer to a varaible of type T
